Is there something or someone that needs acknowledgement?

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

My first work term has been an incredible experience from start to finish that has me more excited for my education than ever before.
I would like to take the time here to acknowledge the individuals who helped make this term the best it could possibly be.

Co-op coordinators: 

  I'd like to give special thanks to my co-op coordinators Kate McRoberts & Anne-Marie Zawadzki, who were always available for any support or inquiry I required and
  for performing a check-in interview with me during the middle of my term to help guide me along the right path and ensure I was doing well.

Peter:

  Furthermore, I'd like to give thanks to my manager Peter Gilmour, who gave me a multitude of valuable knowledge and experience through mentorship and providing me with
  a variety of tasks and projects that allowed me to gain important on the job skills.

Brandon & Arsham:

  Lastly, I'd like to give thanks to my fellow co-workers Arsham Ajami and Brandon Blake, who always answered any question I had and provided incredible support 
  and assistance throughout my term.
