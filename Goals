Goals Intro

During the first month of my work term, I set five individual goals for myself to accomplish during my time at Trade-Mark Industrial Inc.
Throughout my term, I worked to put my goals into achieveable steps to ensure that by the end of my term I had developed 
my skillset with a multitude of interpersonal and technical skills.

Primary Goals

Goal 1:

My first goal consisted of improving my communication skills and being able to share my own opinions and ideas within the workplace to my colleagues. 
I wanted to have a voice within the work place and contribute towards my department whilst I was there to offer a different perspective on how to
accomplish certain tasks or integrate upon software. As my work term continued and I was provided with different projects to work on, my goal shifted
to focus more heavily onto the software side of things and providing my own intepreations on how we could build our project and format the innerworkings.
To achieve my goal, whenever I was given an individual task I would speak with my colleagues on how I'd think to achieve it and ask for feedback on my thought process.
Eventually, I was able to primarily accomplish tasks with little direction and showcase my thought process upon completion. Being able to frequently discuss my work with others
allowed me to greatly improve my sense of communication and confidence within my own ideas. 

Goal 2:
