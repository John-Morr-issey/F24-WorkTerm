          <p class="pA">Established in 1964, the University of Guelph stands today as one of the top institutions in Canada offering a breadth of degrees across eight different colleges. With roots stemming back
          to 1874 and originally operating as an agriculture based school, the University of Guelph has spent over 150 years educating and developing the next generation with their mission to improve life. As it stands today,
          the university has 29,507 undergraduate and graduate students, and over 185,000 alumni from 160+ different countries across the globe.</p>

            The University of Guelph features a multitude of services dedicated to assisting and supporting students. My co-op took place within the Student Housing Services department, more specifically within the South Residence Maritime Hall office. Their main goal is to provide helpful resources to students living in residence during both the application process and existing needs throughout the school year overseeing all 16 on campus residence communities.
            I was employed during the summer, where the focus of the department revolves around organizing new students coming into residence for the fall semester, across 5200+ beds and accomadating a plethora of requests within the residence lottery system.

          <h5 style="text-align: center;">Before my work term started, I set three goals to accomplish over the duration of my time working within the Student Housing Services department. With this work term being
          my second, I wanted to set goals that felt meaningful towards the work I would be doing. They acted as the cornerstones of my work and drove me to strive for better habits and efficeny to maximize what I gained and accomplished within this oppertunity.</h5>

        <div class="col-sm-12" style="padding: 30px;"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-2" style="background-color: mediumturquoise;">
          <h2 style="margin: auto; width: 50%;">Goal 1: Learn something to improve as a developer.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-10" style="background-color: lightseagreen;">
          <p class="pA" >My first goal consisted of learning something new in regards to the development process that can be carried over into future endeavours. Co-op provides the unique oppertunity to work on projects in a different manner than those provided in classwork.
          While there is overlap in how they are tackled in terms of guidelines and deadlines, working without any semblance of grading or rubric means that you need to set your own standards of completion and effectiveness. 
          The project that took the majority of my time during the term revolved around an algorithim running simulations to find the best possible outcome. Whilst I was given no benchmark for it's performance, I realized quickly that taking an 
          entire minute to run 100,000 seeds was horribly inefficent and that I lacked the knowledge on how properly speed things up. This lead me down a path of heavy research into optimization in C, using Callgrind to 
          find where slowdown was occuring and what resource management needed attention. It was only through co-op that I was given the perfect chance to learn more about optimization tools and techniques, utilizing compiler options such as -Ofast and having to ensure it's optimizations did not cause complications.
          Even seemingly inconsequential lines of code that I would never once think to check were changed to maximize speed as much as possible. The 100,000 simulations that once took a minute to run now take a little over a second. 
          Whilst speed is not everything it was a vital part of my skills as a developer that was inherently lacking, and watching as the time my program took slowly came down to become a mere fraction of it's original runtime has
          helped my ability to work towards greater efficeny for my future work.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-2" style="background-color: lightseagreen;">
          <h2 style="margin: auto; width: 50%;">Goal 2: Leave a mark</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-10" style="background-color: mediumturquoise;">
          <p class="pA" >My second goal consisted of improving my creativity of problem solving within coding projects. During the course of my term I was frequently given tasks to 
implement or itterate upon across various software projects. These varied in size and difficulty with certain assignments spanning across a multitude of weeks, I
realized early on that I would need to hone in on my creative ability and out of the box style thinking to properly achieve my goals on time. Over the span of my term 
as I became more comfortable within the enviorment and the technologies used, it became significantly easier to establish creative practices and I found myself finishing
projects at a much faster rate, often being able to come up with a solution fairly quickly and then spending time on implementation. Achieving this goal felt incredibly rewarding
and my inherent skill as a programer has developed greatly as a result.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-2" style="background-color: mediumturquoise;">
          <h2 style="margin: auto; width: 50%;">Goal 3: Make something to be proud of</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-10" style="background-color: lightseagreen;">
          <p class="pA" >My third goal was to improve my time management skills, and ensure that I never miss a deadline during the span of my term. This was a very personal goal as time management has
always been a difficult skill for me to develop, I wanted to get every single task done in a timely manner and never have something run late. At the start of my workterm, I made it
a habit to check in with myself on any active projects every single day. Doing this allowed me to see what was most urgent to get done, how close a project was to being finished, and what
parts of a project needed attention. Through implementing this system, I never had any issue regarding the completion of a task and frequently got things done ahead of schedule. This allowed me
to improve my time management skills, and provided me with extra time to enhance ongoing work and less urgent matters.</p>
